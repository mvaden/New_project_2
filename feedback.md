# Feedback

See [rubric](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/project2/blob/master/evaluation.md)

## Technical Requirements

*Progressing* - You're making progress, but this app doesn't quite demonstrate
proficiency in rails. Right now you have two models, but they aren't really
associated correctly in terms how how users interact with the app. Would also
like to see you get a form for creating a student or assignment working!


## Creativity and Interface

*Progressing* - I understand you spent most of your time (rightly) on
understanding Rails and getting the basics to work, but it would be worth
spending some time practicing CSS in the context of an app you're building, and
to think more about the interface for how people want to use your app.

## Code Quality

*incomplete* - Right now, there isn't really much code for me to look at that
hasn't been copied and pasted from lesson plans. Please see my inline comments
for some feedback on your code.

## Deployment and Functionality

*progressing* - Good job on getting your app deployed! Regarding functionality:
A lot of basic functionality is missing or incomplete... I would suggest focusing
on getting full CRUD for one model (i.e. students ) before moving on to a second.

## Planning / Process / Submission

*Incomplete* - I can't find any user stories, wireframes, ERDs, or a README in
this project repo. If you have them please submit them and let me know so I can
include them in this eval and provide feedback!
